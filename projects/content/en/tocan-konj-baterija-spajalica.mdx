We have partnered with local schools in **Split, Croatia**, to bring digital literacy to life. This project (whose name translates to "Correct Horse Battery Staple", named after the [famous XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/)) is all about giving 7th primary to 2nd secondary graders the information they need to stay safe in a digital-first world.

Most students live their lives online, between social media, gaming, and school apps, but many are still using easily hackable passwords. We’re here to change that in a quick, 25-minute session that actually makes sense to them.

## What We’re Covering

- **Ditching Weak Passwords**: We show students why "123456" and other common picks are a bad idea and how easy they are to crack.
- **The Power of Passphrases**: We teach them the secret to creating long, memorable passphrases that keep hackers out for decades.
- **Next-Level Tools**: Students get a live demo of password managers like Bitwarden and learn how to lock down their accounts with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

## The Goal

Our mission is simple: we want every student in Split to walk away knowing how to generate secure credentials and use pro-level tools to protect their digital identity.
