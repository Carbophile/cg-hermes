For years, we were told to use complex symbols and numbers. However, NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) now emphasizes that [length is the most important factor for a strong password](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity/how-do-i-create-good-password#what-is-nist%E2%80%99s-guidance-for-passwords).

Instead of a "password," we recommend you create a passphrase, a sequence of random words. Specifically, we recommend a 6-word passphrase.

**The Science:** Using a method like "Diceware" to pick six random words provides roughly 78 bits of entropy. While an 8-character password is child's play for a computer, a 15+ character passphrase could take more than 500 years to crack.

Our brains aren't made to remember random digits and characters but instead concepts and stories. That's where the passphrases come in. To make them "sticky" in your brain, you can try a mnemonic story.

**Let's try an example:**

- The words: Blue, Piano, Dancer, Cloud, Forest, and Bicycle
- The story I made up: "A blue piano was played by a dancer on a cloud above a forest while she rode a bicycle."

By visualizing this silly image, you’ve just created a 35+ character "master key" that you will likely never forget, yet a hacker would virtually never be able to guess it.

Now, here is where most people get overwhelmed: _"I can't make a story for every single website!"_

You don't have to. You only need to remember one story. Use your 6-word passphrase as the master password for a trusted password manager like Bitwarden or the open-source KeePassXC.

These tools act as an encrypted vault for your credentials. We love them because they use zero-knowledge encryption, meaning only you (the person with the story) can ever access your data.

Once your vault is set up, stop making up your own passwords for Netflix, Instagram, or your bank. Use the password generator built into your manager.

Now, humans are very bad at random things, so while you'll do great imagining the story, leave the words to the computer. For that, you can use [Bitwarden's Password Generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/).

If you're very paranoid (like me), you might not trust a computer to make up words for you; in that case, you can resort to one of the first recreational objects made by humans. The humble dice. We'll leave it to our friends over at the Electronic Frontier Foundation to [explain to you that process](https://www.eff.org/dice).
